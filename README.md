# Aram-Pro

###### Aram Pro is a website centered around providing metagame data for the All-Random All-Mid (ARAM) gamemode on League of Legends. The basic premise of this app is to provide a central hub for fans of the ARAM game mode to come and share information and use the tools provided to improve their gameplay.

Right now, the site is in early development phases and is primarily an excersise in consuming and utiling the Riot Games API. once the main features are fleshed out, there will be a public release in hopes of generating some substantial user data to help bolster the accuracy and popularity of the website.

This is a Rails app. If you would like to contribute, send an email to [Kevin (Rhoxio)](mailto:rhoxiodbc@gmai.com) to get a copy of the required secret development files.

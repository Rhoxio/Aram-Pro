<p>Right now, the site is in early development phases and is primarily an
excersise in consuming and utiling the Riot Games API. once the main
features are fleshed out, there will be a public release in hopes of
generating some substantial user data to help bolster the accuracy and
popularity of the website.</p>

<p>This is a Rails app with the front-end being built on Foundation and React.
If you would like to contribute, send an email to <a
href="mailto:rhoxiodbc@gmail.com">Kevin (Rhoxio)</a> to get a copy of the
required secret development files. Currently, some key functionality still
needs to be built. Once you get access, check out the issues and start
building!</p>

<p>There are some clear-cut goals that will need to be accomlished before ARAM
Buster (working title) is fully ready to start accepting requests for
simple match analytics. The goal of the feature is to provide users with a
utility that helps them make better decisions baed upon their matchup.
General weaknesses, like sustain being strong against poke teams but weak
against initiation, will be taken in to account.</p>

<p>This functionality will be accomplished by taking a pre-calculated champion
winrate percentage and running an arbitrary &#39;score&#39; (based on
matchup viability; namely on usefulness to their own team and strength
against the enemies&#39; team) and giving back a generalized build path for
the player&#39;s current champion.</p>

<p>For example, let&#39;s say you are playing Alistar versus a heavy poke team
who primarily uses magic damage. Stats like magic resist, health regen,
mana, and tenacity are going to be important things to have as a tank. The
utility should give back suggestions like Spirit Visage or Merc treads. It
may even suggest something like Frozen Heart if the utility sees that
Alistar is the only source of health sustain (any may suggest leveling his
E first) or is the only tank on the team if there is a source of physical
damage on their team.</p>

<h5 id="label-I+Don-27t+Have+Reliable+and+Robust+Analytics+Data+-28Yet-29-2C+So...">I Don&#39;t Have Reliable and Robust Analytics Data (Yet), So…<span><a href="#label-I+Don-27t+Have+Reliable+and+Robust+Analytics+Data+-28Yet-29-2C+So...">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h5>

<p>In order to get initial values that are somewhat accurate, (as I have no
meaningful data at the moment outside of wgat will be scraped) I am going
to scrape a few different websites and run analytics against them to give
the <a href="Championbase.html">Championbase</a> model more robust data on
itself to work with. <strong>(Done)</strong></p>

<p>I am going to have to come up with a table that basically has counters and
strengths highlighted for all tags in the champ_tags hash in the
championbase.rb file. This is going to be self-judgement based until I get
enough data to actually run analytics and calculations against the
pre-assigned tags. It may come to pass that some of the tags get nuked or
end up maintaining precedence over other tags in certain matchups.</p>

<p>An example of ths would be something like: A team with lots of
auto-attacking champions will not be inherently weak against a team with
lots of tanks if there is a high dps mage present and some sort of peel or
hard CC. If they are all squishy and have no way to peel or CC, then their
winrate projection will drop sharply as they have entered a matchup with no
real way to counter the other team outside of itemization and personal
skill. However, if you end up in a matchup where both teams are very poke
heavy, more weight will be given to champions with healing abilities, tanky
initiators (not just initiators), and champions with good early games (as
pressure early with heavy poke can end up snowbaling games out fo control
easily).</p>

<h5 id="label-Persisting+the+Analytics">Persisting the Analytics<span><a href="#label-Persisting+the+Analytics">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h5>

<p>I am planning on caching a lot of the data itself on Redis and doing
perodic dumps to Postgresql on the same database as everything else is
living using Sidekiq.</p>
